 * Rates for the AI usage ledger.
 *
 * Every cost in this codebase is an **integer of micro-USD** (1e-6 USD). Floats
 * accumulate drift across thousands of rows, and per-token rates are 1e-6-scale
 * to begin with — so the natural unit and the storage unit are the same thing.
 *
 * Convenient consequence: **USD per million tokens is numerically identical to
 * micro-USD per token** ($1/MTok = 1e-6 USD/token = 1 µUSD/token). The token
 * rates below therefore read exactly as the providers publish them.
 *
 * Rates are versioned, not mutated. A ledger row keeps the `priceVersion` it
 * was priced at, so re-pricing history is a deliberate migration rather than a
 * silent restatement. When a rate changes: bump `PRICE_VERSION`, edit the
 * table, and leave existing rows alone.
